Classes:
Classes written mostly by myself as part of a group project Summer 2014. 
The project was an android app that allowed users to scan in books that they
have read or wanted to read, sort through them, recommend books to friends, 
view their friend's book lists, and accept or decline recommendations. 
Supporting XML classes may be provided upon request. The friends and recommendation 
system was designed and built by me. Classmates added a few methods to the MainForm.java file
to support activities that they programmed. GitHub was used as the version control program.

	ExpandableUserAdapter.java
	FriendRequest.java
	MainForm.java
	MyExpandableAdapter.java
	RecommendAdapter.java
	Recommendation.java
	UserForm.java

Class written as part of a group networks project to create a TCP-like encapsulation for a UDP 
packet. TCP-like architecture was built over a UDP system with both a client and server.
Class written and designed by me.
